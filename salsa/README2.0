(A) Introduction
=================

The data provided by this SALSA release add a layer of role-semantic
information to TIGER (release 2.1), a syntactically annotated German
newspaper corpus. More information on TIGER can be found here:

http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/projekte/TIGER/


The role-semantic annotation follows the Berkeley FrameNet paradigm:

http://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu

SALSA uses the frames of FrameNet releases 1.2 and 1.3 for the German
annotation, wherever available and appropriate. In addition, SALSA
has developed a number of "proto-frames", i.e., predicate-specific
frames, to provide coverage for predicate instances currently not
covered by FrameNet (see below for encoding details). The total size
of the annotation is currently roughly 20.000 verbal instances and 
more than 17.000 nominal instances. More information on SALSA can 
be found on the website

http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/projects/salsa/

The annotation scheme is described in

The format of the corpus/corpora is SALSA/TIGER XML, documented in:

This 2nd release of the SALSA corpus differs from the 1st release as follows:
 
* The second release includes many more annotations.
* It has a  much larger share of nouns that are analyzed as frame-evoking elements.
* In this second release, more non-core roles are annotated for the nominal frame-evoking elements that
we mainly worked on than for the verbal predicates that were analyzed in the first phase of SALSA.
* The second release uses the syntax trees of version 2.1 of the TIGER corpus--unlike release 1 of
the SALSA corpus, which was based on version 1 of the TIGER corpus. 


(B) List of Files
=================

The release is provided in the form of three packages (1a), (1b), and (2):


(1a) The annotated corpora as individual files, one per lemma. 
--------------------------------------------------------------

- salsa-corpora/abfragen.xml 
- salsa-corpora/abfuellen.xml
...

The files are in SALSA/TIGER XML format (see above) and can be viewed using the 
SALTO tool (see below).


(1b) The annotated corpus as one file.
--------------------------------------

- salsa-corpus.xml

The file is in SALSA/TIGER XML format (see above) and can be viewed
using the SALTO tool (see below). However, for its size, it can only
be displayed on 64-bit machines with at least 3GB of main
memory. Please use the startup scipts Salto_bigmemory.sh (unix) or
Salto_bigmemory.bat (win) instead of the normal Salto.sh or Salto.bat
here.


(2) Auxiliaries
---------------

- html

This folder contains detailed information on the individual frames and frame
elements.

- salsa_frames.xml

This file contains the definitions of the frames used in the
annotation. The file follows the format of the frames.xml file
provided by Berkeley FrameNet. Each frame is labelled with a
"source" attribute that indicates its status. We distinguish four
sources:

1. source="FrameNet1.2" 

   These frames are identical to (i.e., original) FrameNet 1.2 frames.

2. source="SALSA-FrameNet1.2"

   These frames are slightly changed by SALSA, e.g. to account for richer realisation
   possibilities in German.

3. source="SALSA"

   These frames are SALSA-constructed, lemma-specific proto-frames.

4. source="FrameNet1.3"

   These frames exist only on FrameNet 1.3. They are included whenever a frame missing
   in FrameNet 1.2 exists in FrameNet 1.3. In that case, the proto-frame used for
   annotation is identical to the release 1.3 frame, but kept separate for technical 
   reasons.

We additionally created one new semantic role, "Beneficient", which can
occur in most frames (like the peripheral roles "Time" and "Place" in
FrameNet), to account for German datives like in "Sie zapfte IHM ein
Bier".

(C) Statistics on the Annotations
===================

The annotations are summarized by the following set of numbers. 
	
       		 salsa-release    sub-corpora
sentences      		 24184   	36211
frames         		 37697        	37697
uspitem        		  2311        	 2311
fee    	       		 37697    	37697
fe             		 66486          66486
fenode        		109210         109210

The left column applies to the single-file version of the corpus, the right 
column to the sum of all lemma-specific files. The only difference lies in 
the sentence count because some sentences are repeated multiple times in various 
lemma-specific files whereas each Tiger corpus sentence occurs only once in 
the single-file version of the corpus.

Note that the numbers above refer to tokens/instances rather than types. 

Glossary:
- uspitem: cases of Underspecification, where instances of more than one frame 
  are evoked on the same lemma instance and said to co-apply.
- fee: frame-evoking element (what FrameNet calls target instances)
- fe: frame elements/semantic roles
- fenode: nodes in the syntax tree which have been labeled as part of a frame 
  element.


The file salsa_frames.xml contains lexical-unit specific annotation statistics. 
Consider this example:

	<annotation>
         <total type='instances'>112</total>
         <total type='frames'>114</total>
         <annotated type='frames'>1</annotated>
       </annotation>

* The instances total reports how many instances of the lemma in question evoke 
  an instance of some frame.
* The frames total reports how many frame instances are evoked on all the lemma 
  instances taken together. This number may be larger than the previous one 
  because of underspecification.
* The last number reports how many frame instances are annotated for the frame 
  to which the lexical unit belongs.


(D) Useful Software
===================

SALSA also provides a graphical user interface, SALTO, for viewing and
modifying semantic role annotation, available from:

www.coli.uni-saarland.de/projects/salsa/page.php?id=software.

This page also lists other related software.
